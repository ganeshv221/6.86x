Margin boundaries
-----------------

Objective: To pick an optimized decision boundary
Pick a unit distance boundary, scale the data to norm of clasifier function(0)
The margin boundary distance is 1/norm of 0.
Margin boundary function is y(i)*(0.x(i) - 0o)/||0||

Optimize margin boundary 
-------------------------

Maximize the margin boundary -> lower chance test set misclassified
Minimize Loss function -> lower training set value between margin boundary

Stochastic gradient descent
---------------------------
Minimize the sum of loss and margin boundary function
By using derivatives

Quadratic program
-----------------
Finds minimum 0, 0o such that margin boundary max and loss function min
But using quadratic program
